# A front-end application for querying of corpora of Languages of North Macedonia  (Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Rumeli, Macedonian dialects)


## About
The corpus Languages of North Macedonia has been developed in the context of the self-organised working group Romanoslavica and the PhD project The Balkan sprachbund reconsidered. A multi-variate, historicist approach to the ‘prototypical’ case of a sprachbund funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, SNF.

The corpus is a first attempt to provide a cross-linguistic annotation system for different varieties (at the moment Macedonian and Aromanian varieties; in the near future also Albanian and West Rumelian Turkish) that are spoken in North Macedonia and its neighbouring country. The goal of the corpus is to provide linguistic data for the systematic research of the intra-language variation as well as to study phenomena of language contact between the varieties and their speakers in North Macedonia.

## The Aromanian Corpus

The Aromanian corpus The Aromanian data consists of transcriptions of audio files collected during a series of field research trips to the Ohrid, Bitola, Prespa, Struga regions in 2019 and 2021 (gathered in semi-directed interviews based on a questionnaire about local traditions, weddings, celebration of calendar holidays etc., local mythology and folklore, as well as the informants’ biographical stories) as well as transcripts from Gołąb (1984) and Cândroveanu (1977).

## Notes on Annotation

The sources are annotated according to MultextEAST Damaskini specifications for morphology and Universal Dependencies for syntax. This system was used in order to study phenomena of language contact between varieties.
